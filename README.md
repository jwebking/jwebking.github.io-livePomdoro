# livePomdoro

A pomodoro clock I made for FreeCodeCamp.com, set live on GitPages. 

What's a pomodoro clock? It's the main component of the pomodoro technique! The dafult is work for 25 minutes, break for 5, then repeat. 
But everyone is different. Maybe work 50, break for 10, or work for 2hrs, break for 20 minutes. You do you.
