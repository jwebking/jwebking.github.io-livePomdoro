# livePomdoro

A pomodoro clock I made for FreeCodeCamp.com, set live on GitPages. 

What's a pomodoro clock? It's the main component of the pomodoro technique! The default setting is work for 25 minutes, take a break for 5 minutes, then get back to work and repeat. 
But everyone is different. Maybe work 50, break for 10, or work for 2hrs, break for 20 minutes. You do you.
